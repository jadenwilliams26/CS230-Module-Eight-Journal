The client Chat Away was seeking to develop a mobile app version of their successful website. This app needed to function on both Apple and Android. Throughout this project I believe my ability to research the strengths and weaknesses of each operating platform and my ability to express the research is something I did exceptionally well. <br/>
When filing out this design document, I found that by researching each topic more in depth I was able to decide the way I wanted to begin development more easily and where I wanted to take the project. I was able to lay out my plan and execute it much more easily. I did find that it is difficult to know the stopping point in research though, there is a definite spot where enough is enough and anything more is not helpful to the project anymore. <br/>
I feel as if I could have gone more in depth when describing each OS. I shorted a lot of it and I felt as if some detail was lost, so in the future I will work on formulating better more descriptive definitions. <br/>
I approached the design of the software by keeping the clients needs forefront in mind. When the clients needs are met it shows that as a developer I am focused on them and only them and will create a product they will be proud of, which in turn is a product I am proud of.
